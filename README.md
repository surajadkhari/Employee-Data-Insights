Excel Data Analysis Functions Repository

Welcome to my Excel Data Analysis Functions repository! This project is part of my learning journey to become a Data Analyst, currently in my second week of exploring Excel's advanced functions and their applications in solving business problems.

📊 About the Project

This repository contains datasets and practical Excel formulas that help answer common business questions. Each solution applies essential Excel functions for data analysis, focusing on real-world scenarios like salary breakdowns, employee information lookup, and performance tracking.

The goal of this project is to master core Excel functions used in data analytics and showcase my ability to extract insights and present data effectively.

INDEX + MATCH – A powerful alternative to VLOOKUP for complex queries.

Data Aggregation:

SUMIF, SUMIFS – Summing salaries and headcounts by department and criteria.

COUNTIF, COUNTIFS – Counting employees based on multiple conditions.

AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFS – Calculating average salaries by department and other attributes.

Data Filtering and Extraction:

FILTER – Extracting specific records such as high-salary female employees.

CHOOSECOLS – Select specific columns dynamically.

Text and Data Handling:

TEXTJOIN – Combining multiple department names into a single cell.

Statistical Analysis:

MIN, MAX, LARGE – Identifying lowest, highest, and top salary values.

SORT + TAKE – Organizing and limiting results for better insights.

Logical and Error Handling:

IFERROR – Handling errors in lookups and calculations gracefully.
